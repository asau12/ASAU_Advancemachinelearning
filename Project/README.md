Attention Mechanism For Image Caption Generation

Attention mechanism is a complex cognitive ability that human beings possess. When people receive information, they can consciously focus on some of the main information while ignoring other secondary information. This ability of human beings to see some part of the images or textual information in high resolution and blur out the rest is known as attention.

Image caption generator is a model which generates caption based on the features present in the input image. In this project, we tend to amalgamate Image caption generation and attention mechanism to output caption for input images.
